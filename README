This is Countdown version 1.0
=============================

Countdown is a simple program to tell you days from the deadline.


How to Use
==========

To use this program, you should install Python, and tkinter module
should be available. This program is written in Python 3.3.2.

When you use this program, you just need to fill deadline and event
in line 5 and line 6 in the script file, and let this script file 
run automatically at boot.


** Windows **
If you use Windows, you should change script file's name's suffix to
"pyw", so that this program will not open a console window, which is 
redundant.
